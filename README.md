# Group 209 App

## App Description
The app’s landing page will include a heatmap representing the map of the world, that shows the proportion of an alcoholic drink consumed by each country, relative to the total alcohol consumption of the country. The user will be able to filter the map based on three alcoholic drinks: Beer, Wine and Spirits, using a drop-down list. Once a drink is selected by the user, the map’s title will update to the name of the drink, and the map will update to show the data relevant to the drink chosen. To the right of the map, there will be a legend showing the proportion of the drink consumed, using a color scale. As the map is a heatmap, the countries are color coded based on the level of the proportion of the alcoholic drink consumed. The map in the app is interactive, and the user will be able to pan the view by clicking and dragging and will be able to zoom into areas of the map. As well, by hovering over a country, a square tooltip will appear, showing the country’s name, the proportion of the drink consumed, the absolute value of the drink consumed and the country’s global rank of proportion, compared to the other countries.  With the app, users will be able to discover and compare the drinking preferences of the countries of the world.
